# VBA-Excel-Seasonality-Forcasting 

## Discription
This tool has been built for VBA (Windows and Mac Excel, and plan on incorperating into Access)

Currently this annylasis tool uses the [Multiplicative Decomposition Model](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/sa-elearning/multiplicative-decomposition) (with plans to add alternative methods) to Deseasonalize data to smooth in order to represent that data in a standard graph. 
Yt=Trend(levels)*Season(t)*Irregular(t)

### Benefits

Measuring seasonality of a data set can help organizations plan for the future. Seasonality can be caused by various factors such as weather vacation or holidays. 

### Limitations

The excel limitations that consern this tool are as follows:
* "Cover" sheet Cells C2, F2, F5,  and F7 are static (Can't be moved) 
* "Data" Sheet must start with three uniqe values, "Category, Date, Values" (the fourth Column is created at runtime) 
* "Historical Periods" is the number of periods to display on the chart, all data will be used to calculate the forecast line 
* "Dataset Has Values of '0' " is set to False by default if your data set has 0's then is must also have a value for every category on each date entry (or you will need to make your 0's  = 1x10^-20)  
* All week Calculations and groupings conform to ISO 8601 i.e. a year has 53 weeks every 5.6338 years (starting in 2004) 
* The number of Categories can not exceed 126 The number of Rows can not exceed 1048575
